Release history for Perl module BackPAN::Index::Create

0.03 2014-05-03
    - Got rid of my one use of // so I could drop down to requiring 5.6. Sigh.
    - The SYNOPSIS made it look like create_backpan_index() is always exported.
      It isn't, so updated SYNOPSIS to make that clear.
    - Added some real tests.
    - Improved the introductory part of the documentation, adding a link
      to backpan.perl.org

0.02 2014-05-01
    - Got rid of uses of __SUB__ (which on checking,
      I had misunderstood anyway), so I could drop the Perl version dependency
      to 5.010 (from 5.16). Nudged by BARBIE.

0.01 2014-04-13
    - First release to CPAN
